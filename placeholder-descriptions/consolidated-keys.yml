      This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for configuring Rich Text
      formatting. Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the
      value of `source`) and must end in the file extension `.cloudcannon.editables.yml`. You can use this
      key anywhere you would use the `_editables` key in the configuration cascade. This key has no
      default.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, we have several WYSIWYG Toolbar *Configuration Files* in the
          `.cloudcannon/editables/` folder, with each file containing multiple definitions. The value of the
          `_editables_from_glob` key tells CloudCannon all files in that folder that match the glob
          `*.cloudcannon.editables.yml`.

    definition: >
      This key defines which editing interfaces are available by default for files at a given level of the
      configuration cascade. Whether an editing interface is available for a specific file is determined
      by other factors. Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`. Specifying one
      or more editing interfaces will disable all unspecified editing interfaces. You cannot disable the
      Source Editor with this key. By default, this key is set to `visual`, `content`, and `data`. If
      undefined at higher levels of the [configuration
      cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_enabled_editables` will
      default to any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration
      file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).

  - label: "_inputs.*.cascade"
    type_markdown: "Boolean"
    source_file: "inputs-reference"
    definition: >
      This key determines whether CloudCannon should merge this input configuration with any matching,
      less specific configurations elsewhere in the configuration cascade. The [configuration
      cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) works by finding the most
      specific `_inputs` entry. Usually, once an option is found in the cascade, there's no reason to keep
      looking. When this key is `true`, the cascade continues looking and each entry found is merged. This
      key allows you to define some options globally while using specific options for other keys at
      different levels of the cascade. For example, define a `comment` globally, but use
      collection-specific `label` for inputs in different collections. You can stop the cascade at any
      point in the configuration cascade by setting `cascade` to `false`. By default, this key is `true`
      (i.e., merges all configurations for an input in the cascade).

  - label: "_inputs.*.disabled"
    type_markdown: "Boolean or string"
    source_file: "inputs-reference"
    definition: >
      This key toggles whether the value of an input is editable in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the
      Visual or Content Editor. Disabled inputs are useful if you want CloudCannon to display the input
      value, but prevent team members from editing the value outside of the Source Editor. The value of
      this key can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true` will prevent team members from
      editing the value. A string value can prevent team members from editing an input based on the value
      of another input. You can reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning. * `published`
      hides an input when the sibling input `published` is truthy * `!published` hides an input when the
      sibling input `published` is falsy For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'`
      or `"` quotation marks. By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can edit input values).
    examples:

      This key toggles the visibility of an input in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or
      Content Editor. Hidden inputs are useful when you want an input to exist, but not be visible or
      editable outside of the Source Editor. Value can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true`
      will hide the input. A string value can hide an input based on the value of another input. You can
      reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning. * `published` hides an input when the
      sibling input `published` is truthy * `!published` hides an input when the sibling input `published`
      is falsy For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'` or `"` quotation marks. By
      default, this key follows the input naming convention where key names beginning with an underscore
      are hidden `true`.

  - label: "_inputs.*.instance_value"
    type_markdown: "String"
    source_file: "inputs-reference"
    definition: >
      This key determines whether an input is automatically populated with a value when the input is
      created. This occurs when creating a new file, or adding array items containing this input. Valid
      values are `UUID` or `NOW`. * `UUID` generates a uuidv4 key (extremely unlikely to generate
      duplicates), useful for identifying unique items (e.g. `6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0b`) *
      `NOW` generates the current datetime in the Site's configured timezone This key has no default.

      This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for *Collection*
      configuration. Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the
      value of `source`) and must end in the file extension `.cloudcannon.snippets-imports.yml`. You can
      use this key anywhere you would use the `_snippets_imports` key in the configuration cascade. This
      key has no default.

      `schema` * `default_content_file` The following nested keys are available for each URL entry in
      `add_options`: * `name` * `icon` * `href` By default, CloudCannon adds the "Add a file" and "Create

      This key enables you to edit custom markup in rich text editors and explicitly accept the risk of
      unintentionally deleting elements that cannot be recreated. By default, `allow_custom_markup` is
      `false` for inputs and the Content Editor and `true` for editable regions. When using
      `allow_custom_markup` outside of editable regions, content that uses JavaScript will not be editable
      for security reasons. These inputs will appear as uneditable snippets. Available for the Content
      Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block editable region (`_editables.block`), the Link editable
      region (`_editables.link`), the Text editable region (`_editables.text`), and Rich Text inputs
      (`_inputs.key_name.options`). For more information, please read our documentation on best practices
      for HTML in [rich text](/documentation/articles/best-practices-for-rich-text/) and [editable

      This key toggles whether CloudCannon should treat an entry in the `values` array as the default
      option for your Object or Array input. If multiple entries in the `values` array are set to `true`,
      CloudCannon will use the first entry. If CloudCannon cannot determine the type of an entry within
      the `values` array based on the `id_key` or matching inputs in the `values.value` array, it will
      fall back to the default entry. By default, this key is `false` (i.e., the entry is not the default
      option).
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, we want the entry labelled `Employee` to be our default option for populating
          inputs configured with the `staff` Structure.

  - label: "glob"
    type_markdown: "Array of Strings"
    source_file: "collections-reference"
    definition: >
      This key defines globs which filter the files visible in the *Collection browser* for a given
      Collection. Values in this array are relative to the Collection
      [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path). Globs can be positive (e.g. `*.yml`),
      or negative (e.g. `!**/*.json`). Files are included in a Collection if they match any positive globs
      and do not match any negative globs. If you do not define any positive globs, CloudCannon will
      include all non-developer files in a Collection unless they match a negative glob. For more
      information about developer files, please read our documentation on the
      [include\_developer\_files](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#include_developer_files)
      key. Defining a negative glob for a Collection does not remove a file from the associated Collection
      folder in your Git repository. Similarly, defining a positive glob for a file in a folder outside
      your Collection path does not move the file. This key has no default.

      This key defines how image files are resized prior to upload, using a bounding box defined by
      `width` and `height` options. Defaults to `contain`. Valid values are `contain`, `cover` or
      `stretch`: * `cover` keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image covers the bounding box * `contain`
      keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image fits inside the bounding box * `stretch` ignores aspect
      ratio and resizes the image to the bounding box This key does not apply to existing images, and does
      not work if `width` and `height` options are not defined. Available for the Content Editor
      (`_editables.content`), the Block editable region (`_editables.block`), the Image editable region

  - label: "schemas_from_glob"
    type_markdown: "Array of Strings"
    source_file: "configuration-file-reference"
    definition: >
      This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for *Schema* configuration.
      Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the value of
      `source`) and must end in the file extension `.cloudcannon.schemas.yml`. You can use this key
      anywhere you would use the `schemas` key. This key has no default.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, we have several *Schemas Configuration Files* in the `.cloudcannon/schemas/`
          folder. The value of the `schemas_from_glob` key tells CloudCannon to use all files in that folder
          that match the glob `*.cloudcannon.schemas.yml` except for `pages.cloudcannon.schemas.yml` due to
          the negative glob.

  - label: "singular_name"
    type_markdown: "String"
    source_file: "collections-reference"
    definition: >
      This key defines the singular noun for your Collection name. CloudCannon uses the singular noun in
      the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection browser* when you select the option to add a
      new file. This is useful if your Collection name is an irregular plural (e.g., "syllabi" or
      "syllabuses" to "syllabus"). By default, CloudCannon removes the `s` character from regular plurals
      to create a singular noun (e.g., "posts" to "post"). This key has no default.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, the *\+ Add* button option to add a Collection file will read "Add Team Member"
          rather that "Add Team".

    source_file: "collections-reference"
    definition: >
      This key defines how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files when you first open your *Collection
      browser*. Configuring this key allows you to sort your Collection using a structured data key in
      your files. The following nested keys are available: * `key` (required) * `order` By default,
      CloudCannon sorts your Collection files alphabetically by filename in ascending order by default.
      However, if you have configured the
      [sort\_options](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#sort_options) key, CloudCannon will
      use the first array item in `sort_options`. If you use the *Sort* dropdown in your *Collection
      browser* to order your Collection files, CloudCannon will preferentially use your most recent
      sorting method over the value configured in the `sort` key.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front
          matter of each file, in descending order.

      This key defines the options for the *Sort* dropdown in a *Collection browser*. Configuring sort
      options for a Collection will remove CloudCannon's default sorting options from the *Sort* dropdown.
      The following nested keys are available for each entry in the `sort_options` array: * `key`
      (required) * `order` * `label` By default, CloudCannon provides sorting options for path, file size,
      file creation time, and last modified, in ascending and descending order. CloudCannon will also read
      data keys from your early Collection files and provide options to sort by those key values.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, the *Sort* dropdown in the `blog` *Collection browser* only contains options for
          sorting by `author` and `date` in ascending and descending order.

      empty inputs will be visible in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/)
      but not the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). For this key to
      function, you must also configure id_key for the Structure, as removing inputs prevents CloudCannon
      from comparing Structure values. By default, this key is `false` (i.e, CloudCannon does not remove
      empty inputs). You can also configure this behavior for all values of a Structure using
      structure.remove_empty_inputs.

    definition: >
      This key defines how CloudCannon shows Structure options to populate an Object or Array input. This
      can be using a Select-style search bar or a pop-up modal. Modals are useful when you have several
      value options for your Structure. Values can be one of the following: `select`, or `modal`. By
      default, this key is `select`.
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, the `related_articles` Structure only has one option so a `select` searchbar is
          appropriate.

      This key enables a dropdown menu to apply a style to selected text. Styles are the combination of an
      element and class name. The value for this option is the path (either source or build output) for
      the CSS file containing styles. Available for the Content Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block

      This key toggles whether CloudCannon should create tabs in the Data Editor if you have two layers of
      nested object within your Structure. CloudCannon would create tabs automatically for Non-unified
      Configuration Sites, but it must be explicitly configured in the Unified Configuration file format.
      By default, this key is `false` (i.e., Object and Array inputs using this Structure option are not
      tabbed).
    examples:
      - description: >
          In this example, we want the `content` and `style` keys in our Structure to be tabs at the top of
          the Data Editor, with the `title` and `text`, and `color` and `font` keys nested within those tabs
          respectively.

      This key defines which tags are associated with a given value in a Structure. You can use tags to
      group and filter Structure options when selecting from a modal. The `style` key must be set to
      `modal` for this key to function. This key has no default.
    examples:

          In this example we have three options for the `page_components` Structure: `Hero Component`,
          `Feature Component`, and `Video Component`. We can search the Structure modal using the `image`,

      Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom
      Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/). Values for this key can be a mix of plain
      text and template strings, and should begin and end with the `/` character. Template strings can
      contain data placholders and fixed placeholders, which CloudCannon will replace with the data it
