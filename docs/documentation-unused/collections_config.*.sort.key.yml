  This key defines which key CloudCannon should use to sort files in your *Collection browser*. You must define this key for the `sort` object to function.

  Value must be the name of a structured data key in your Collection files. If some files in your Collection do not have this data key, CloudCannon will sort those in ascending alphabetical order, after the file sorted by your data key in the *Collection browser*.

  This key has no default.
examples:
  - description: In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front matter of each file, in descending order.
