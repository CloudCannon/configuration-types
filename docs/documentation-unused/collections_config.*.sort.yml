  **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This key is deprecated. Use `sort_options` instead.

  This key defines how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files when you first open your *Collection browser*. Configuring this key allows you to sort your Collection using a structured data key in your files.

  The following nested keys are available:

  * `key` (required)
  * `order`

  By default, CloudCannon sorts your Collection files alphabetically by filename in ascending order by default. However, if you have configured the [sort\_options](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#sort_options) key, CloudCannon will use the first array item in `sort_options`.

  If you use the *Sort* dropdown in your *Collection browser* to order your Collection files, CloudCannon will preferentially use your most recent sorting method over the value configured in the `sort` key.
examples:
  - description: In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front matter of each file, in descending order.
