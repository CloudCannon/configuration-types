  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will reorder inputs in a file to match the order defined in a given
  Structure. By default, this key is `true` (i.e, inputs are reordered to match the Structure). You can also
  configure this behavior for specific values of a Structure using `structure.values.[*].reorder_inputs`.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we want to preserve the order of the inputs in a file
      over the order in the associated Structure.
