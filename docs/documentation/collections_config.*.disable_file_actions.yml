  This key toggles whether team members can use the *Move*, *Clone*, *Rename*, and *Delete* file actions in a Collections. You can normally access these file actions in the *Context Menu* at the top right of a file [Card](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/) in
  the *Collection browser* or in an editing interface.
  
  Setting this key to `true` will prevent team members from using file actions in the *Collection browser*.  This key does not affect file actions in the *File browser*.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can use file actions) for most SSGs.
  
  For Eleventy, Hugo, and Jekyll, this key defaults to `true` for the `data` Collection.

      In this example, we want to prevent team members from using file actions
      in the `data` Collection through the *Collection browser*.
