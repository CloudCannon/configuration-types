  This key defines the maximum numerical value CloudCannon will allow in an
  Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from entering a greater
  numerical value. If the Input already contains a greater numerical value,
  CloudCannon will require you to enter a valid value to save your changes, or
  discard your unsaved changes. This key is required for `range` inputs.


  Value can be any integer. If `options.min` is also configured, this key cannot
  be a lesser number.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Number Inputs.
