  This key defines double and single quotes replacement pairs for quote beautification when `typographer` is enabled.

  The value is a string that specifies quote pairs. For example, you can use `"«»„""` for Russian, `""„"‚""` for German, and `["«\xA0", "\xA0»", "‹\xA0", "\xA0›"]` for French (including `nbsp`).

  This key only takes effect when `typographer` is enabled.

  This key has no default value.
