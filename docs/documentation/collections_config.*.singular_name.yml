  This key defines the singular noun for your Collection name.


  CloudCannon uses the singular noun in the *\+ Add* button in the top right of
  the *Collection browser* when you select the option to add a new file.


  This is useful if your Collection name is an irregular plural (e.g., "syllabi"
  or "syllabuses" to "syllabus").
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, the *\+ Add* button option to add a Collection file will
      read "Add Team Member" rather that "Add Team".
