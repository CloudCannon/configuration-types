  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide the options to link to an existing file, and upload a new file.
  
  Setting this key to `true` will hide the options to link to an existing file and upload a new file. This does not prevent typing a file path in the input.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., the options to link to an existing file and upload a new file are shown).
