  This key toggles whether CloudCannon should treat an entry in the `values`
  array as the default option for your Object or Array input. If multiple
  entries in the `values` array are set to `true`, CloudCannon will use the
  first entry.


  If CloudCannon cannot determine the type of an entry within the `values` array
  based on the `id_key` or matching inputs in the `values.value` array, it will
  fall back to the default entry.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., the entry is not the default option).

      In this example, we want the entry labelled `Employee` to be our default
      option for populating inputs configured with the `staff` Structure.
