  This key toggles whether CloudCannon should treat an entry in the `values`
  array as the default option for your Object or Array input.


  Setting this key to `true` will mark this entry as the default option for your
  Object or Array input. If multiple entries in the `values` array are set to
  `true`, CloudCannon will use the first entry. If CloudCannon cannot determine
  the type of an entry within the `values` array based on the `id_key` or
  matching inputs across `values[*].value` objects,

  it will fall back to the default entry.

      In this example, we want the entry labelled `Employee` to be our default
      option for populating inputs configured with the `staff` Structure.
