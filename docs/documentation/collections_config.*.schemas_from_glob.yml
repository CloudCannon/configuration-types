  This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for
  *Schema* configuration.


  Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`,
  not the value of `source`) and must end in the file extension

  `.cloudcannon.schemas.yml`.


  You can use this key anywhere you would use the `schemas` key.


  This key has no default.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we have several *Schemas Configuration Files* in the
      `.cloudcannon/schemas/` folder. The value of the `schemas_from_glob` key
      tells CloudCannon to use all files in that folder that match the glob
      `*.cloudcannon.schemas.yml` except for `pages.cloudcannon.schemas.yml` due
      to the negative glob.
