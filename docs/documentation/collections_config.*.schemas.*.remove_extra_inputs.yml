  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove inputs that are not present
  in a Schema from a file before loading it in an Editing Interface.


  Setting this key to `false` will preserve inputs that are not present in a
  Schema, making them visible in the [Visual
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), [Content

  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), and [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and they will be
  saved to your Git repository.

      `article` schema in the `blog` Collection.
