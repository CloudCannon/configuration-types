  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove inputs that are not present in a Schema from a file before loading it in an Editing Interface.
  
  If set to `true`, non-Schema inputs will not be visible in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), [Content
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), or [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and saving the file
  will remove them from the file before persisting the changes to your Git repository.
  
  By default, this key is `true` (i.e., inputs not present in the Schema are removed from the file).
