description: |-
  Sets the behavior when editing existing files with inputs not present in the schema. Defaults to `true`.

  If `true`, non-schema inputs are removed before the editor loads, and subsequently removed from the source file if saved.

  If `false`, non-schema inputs are either hidden or visible in the editor depending on `hide_extra_inputs`, but still kept in the source file on save.

  If any inputs conflict with schema (e.g. a file's `title` is a string and the schema's `title` is an object), the schema version takes priority.
