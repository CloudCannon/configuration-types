  This key defines the valid tokens that can bound a string when parsing snippet parameters.

  The value is an array of strings, where each string specifies a valid boundary token. The parser will ensure the matched end token is the same as the start token. To handle common strings with either single or double quotes, this would usually be `["'", "\""]`.

examples:
