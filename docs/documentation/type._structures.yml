title: Structures
description: |-
  This key defines which structures are available for [Object inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-object-input/) and [Array
  inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-array-input/) at a given level of the configuration cascade.

  This key has no default.

  If undefined at higher levels of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_structures` will default to
  any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).

  For more information, please read our documentation on [structures](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-structure/).
