  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove inputs that are not present in a given value from a Structure
  from a file before loading it in an Editing Interface. If set to `true`, non-Structure inputs will not be  visible
  in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/),  [Content
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), or  [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and saving the file will remove  them from the file
  before persisting the changes to your Git repository. By default, this key is `false` (i.e., inputs not present in
  the Structure value are not removed from the file). You can also configure this behavior for all values of a
  Structure using `structure.remove_extra_inputs`.
