  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will allow you to edit custom markup in
  rich text editors and explicitly accept the risk of unintentionally deleting
  elements that cannot be recreated.


  Setting this key to `true` will enable editing of custom markup. When using
  `allow_custom_markup` outside of editable regions, content that uses
  JavaScript will not be editable for security reasons. These inputs will appear
  as uneditable snippets.
