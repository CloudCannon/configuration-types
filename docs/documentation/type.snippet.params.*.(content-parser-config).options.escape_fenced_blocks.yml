  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will escape fenced code blocks (triple backticks) when parsing content.

  Setting this key to `true` will escape fenced code blocks in the content, preventing them from being interpreted as code blocks.

  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., fenced code blocks are not escaped).
