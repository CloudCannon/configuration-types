  This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for *Collection* configuration. Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the value of `source`) and must end in the file extension `.cloudcannon.snippets-imports.yml`. You can use this key anywhere you would use the `_snippets_imports` key in the configuration cascade.

  This key has no default.
examples:
  - description: In this example, we have several Snippet *Configuration Files* in the `.cloudcannon/snippets/` folder. The value of the `_snippets_import_from_glob` key tells CloudCannon all files in that folder that match the glob `*.cloudcannon.snippets-import.yml`.
