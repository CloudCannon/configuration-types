  This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for
  *Collection* configuration. Values in this array are relative to the root of
  your repository (i.e., `/`, not the value of `source`) and must end in the
  file extension `.cloudcannon.snippets-imports.yml`. You can use this key
  anywhere you would use the `_snippets_imports` key in the configuration
  cascade.


  This key has no default.

      In this example, we have several Snippet *Configuration Files* in the
      `.cloudcannon/snippets/` folder. The value of the
      `_snippets_import_from_glob` key tells CloudCannon all files in that
      folder that match the glob `*.cloudcannon.snippets-import.yml`.
