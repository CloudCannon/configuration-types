  This key defines the Collection for files created using an option in the *\+
  Add* button dropdown. This Collections overrides the current Collection open
  in the *Collection browser*.


  The value for this key should be the key name of a Collection.


  By default, this key is the current Collection open in the *Collection
  browser*.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we want team members in the articles Collection to create
      new files in the `new_articles` Collection rather than the current
      Collection browser they have open. By configuring the `collection` value
      to `new_articles`, new files will be created in a different Collection
      (i.e., `new_articles`) when a team member selects this option from the +
      Add button dropdown.
