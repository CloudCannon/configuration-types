  This key defines the commit template to use when pulling changes from the
  upstream repository.


  An upstream commit message template can contain plain text and placeholders.
  Placeholders insert data related to the commit and use `[ ]` brackets.
  CloudCannon supports the following commit placeholders:


  * `[branch]` — the name of the current branch.

  * `[publish_branch]` — the name of the Publish Branch from which you merge
  upstream changes.

  * `[author]` — the email address of the person responsible for the upstream
  merge.

  * `[date]` — the date of the upstream merge in the format "Tue Nov 28 2023
  21:46:17 GMT+0000".
