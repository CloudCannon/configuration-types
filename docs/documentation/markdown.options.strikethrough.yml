  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will output strikethrough text wrapped in
  double tildes when converting HTML to Markdown.


  Setting this key to `true` will output strikethrough text as `~~strike~~` in
  Markdown.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., strikethrough text is not output in
  double tildes format).
