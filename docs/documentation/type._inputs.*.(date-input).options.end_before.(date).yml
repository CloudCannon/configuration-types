description: >-
  This key defines the date and time, exclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in
  an Input.


  When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting a later date and
  time.


  If the Input already contains a later date and time, CloudCannon will require
  you to change it to a valid value to save your changes, or discard your

  unsaved changes.


  Value must be in
  [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format.


  If `options.start_from` is also configured, this key cannot be an earlier date
  and time.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Date and Time Inputs.
