  This key toggles whether team members can use the *+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection browser* to add files to a Collection.
  
  Setting this key to `true` will prevent team members from adding new files through the *Collection browser*. This key does not affect your ability to add files using the *File browser*.
  
  If both `disable_add` and `disable_add_folder` are set to `true`, the *\+ Add* button will not
  appear in the top right of the *Collection browser*.
