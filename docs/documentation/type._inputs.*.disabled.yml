  This key defines whether the value of an input is editable in the *Data
  Editor* or the sidebar of the *Visual Editor* or *Content Editor*.


  Disabled inputs are useful if you want CloudCannon to display the input value,
  but prevent team members from editing the value outside of the Source

  Editor.


  The value of this key can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true`
  will prevent team members from editing the value.


  A string value can prevent team members from editing an input based on the
  value of another input.


  You can reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning.


  * `published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is truthy

  * `!published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is falsy


  For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'` or `"`
  quotation marks.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can edit input values).

      In this example, we have configured the `date_created` Date input, which
      will automatically populate when you create a file using this input.
      Editors cannot alter this input as the interface is disabled.
