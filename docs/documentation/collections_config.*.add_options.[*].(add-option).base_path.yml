  This key defines a path for files created using an option in the *\+ Add*
  button dropdown. This path overrides the path for the current Collection and
  subfolder open in the *Collection browser*. This key is useful if you need to
  specify a specific subfolder within a Collection.


  The value for this key is relative to your Collection
  [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path).


  By default, this key is the path for the current Collection and subfolder open
  in the *Collection browser*.

      In this example, we want team members in the `_posts` Collection to create
      new files in the`blog` subfolder of the `_drafts` Collection rather than
      the current *Collection browser* they have open. By configuring the
      `base_path` value to `/../_drafts/blog`, new files will be created in a
      different Collection subfolder (i.e., `_drafts`) when a team member
      selects this option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.
