  This key defines the display name for a Collection.


  The name appears in the *Site Navigation* and at the top of the *Collection
  browser*.


  Changing the display name does not affect the Collection key name.


  By default, CloudCannon uses the Collection key name in title case (i.e.,
  `blog_files` becomes "Blog Files").
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, CloudCannon will call the `blog` Collection "Travel Blog"
      in the *Site Navigation* and the *Collection browser*.
