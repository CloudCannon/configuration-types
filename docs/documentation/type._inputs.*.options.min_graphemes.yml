  This key defines the minimum string length, in graphemes, that CloudCannon
  will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will warn you when an
  Input value is too short. If the Input already contains a shorter value,
  CloudCannon will require you to add characters until the Input contains a
  valid string to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.
