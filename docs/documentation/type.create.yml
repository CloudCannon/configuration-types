      In this example, CloudCannon will generate a Create Path for new files in
      the `blog` Collection using the `date` and `title` structured data keys.
      For example, CloudCannon will generate a create path of
      `blog/2024-10-31-spooky-getaway.md` for a file with the date 31st October
      2024 and the title "Spooky Getaway".
