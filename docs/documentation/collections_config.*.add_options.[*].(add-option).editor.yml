title: Editor Key
description: |-
  This key defines which editing interface CloudCannon will use when you select an option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.

  Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`.

  By default, CloudCannon will open the new file in an appropriate editing interface for that file type. If CloudCannon cannot determine an appropriate editing interface, it will show a warning.
