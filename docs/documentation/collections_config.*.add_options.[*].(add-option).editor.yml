title: Editor Key
description: >-
  This key defines which editing interface CloudCannon will use when you select
  an option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.


  Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`.


  By default, CloudCannon will open the new file in an appropriate editing
  interface for that file type.


  If CloudCannon cannot determine an appropriate editing interface, it will show
  a warning.

      In this example, we have configured a standard add option for the `people`
      Collection that opens new files in the [Data
      Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/).
