title: Query String
description: |-
  This key represents a query string value for the `disabled` key that conditionally prevents editing of an input value based on another input's value.

  The value is a string that references a sibling input key name. CloudCannon evaluates the referenced input's value to determine whether to disable this input.

  When the referenced input is truthy, CloudCannon disables this input. You can reverse this behavior by prefixing the string with `!`.

  For reverse values in YAML files, the string should be wrapped in single or double quotation marks.

  This key has no default value.
