  This key defines globs that filter which files CloudCannon should use for *Collection* configuration. Values in this array are relative to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the value of `source`) and must end in the file extension `.cloudcannon.collections.yml`. You can use this key anywhere you would use the `collections_config` key.

  This key has no default.
examples:
  - description: In this example, each *Collection* has its own *Configuration File* in the `.cloudcannon/collections/` folder. The value of the `collections_config_from_glob` key tells CloudCannon to use all files in that folder that match the glob `*.cloudcannon.collections.yml`.
