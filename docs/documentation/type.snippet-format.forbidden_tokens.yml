  Stops parsing content as soon as one of these tokens is encountered.

  Useful when the content parser is being greedy and consuming more input than
  intended.
examples:
  - description: ''
    language: yaml
    code: |-
      parser: "content"
      options:
        editor_key: highlighted_text
        forbidden_tokens: ['<']
    annotations: []
    source: cloudcannon.config.yml
  - description: 'Example usage:'
    language: markdown
    code: |-
      ## My blog post

      <<highlight>> My content <</highlight>> <!--1-->

      <<highlight>> My < content <</highlight>> <!--2-->

      Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.
    annotations:
      - number: 1
        content: >-
          This snippet does not contain a forbidden token, so will parse and
          return correctly.
      - number: 2
        content: >-
          This snippet **does** contain a forbidden token, and will not match.


          This isn't particularly useful in this example, but is generally used
          to prevent the content

          parser from consuming the end token of itself.
