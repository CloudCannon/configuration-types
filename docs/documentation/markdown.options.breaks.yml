  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will convert line breaks (`\n`) in
  paragraphs into `<br>` tags when converting Markdown to HTML.


  Setting this key to `true` will convert line breaks within paragraphs into
  `<br>` tags.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., line breaks in paragraphs are not
  converted to `<br>` tags).
