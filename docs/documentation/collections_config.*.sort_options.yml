  This key defines the options for the *Sort* dropdown in a *Collection
  browser*.


  Configuring sort options for a Collection will remove CloudCannon's default
  sorting options from the *Sort* dropdown.


  By default, CloudCannon provides sorting options for path, file size, file
  creation time, and last modified, in ascending and descending order.


  CloudCannon will also read data keys from your early Collection files and
  provide options to sort by those key values.
examples:

      In this example, the *Sort* dropdown in the `blog` *Collection browser*
      only contains options for sorting by `author` and `date` in ascending and
      descending order.
