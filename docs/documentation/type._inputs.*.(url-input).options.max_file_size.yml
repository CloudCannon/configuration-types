  This key defines the maximum file size, in kilobytes, that CloudCannon will
  allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from
  uploading a file larger than the specified size. If the Input already contains
  a file larger than the specified size, CloudCannon will require you to change
  it to a valid value to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.
  Value can be any positive integer.
