  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will use relative paths instead of
  absolute paths for uploaded files.


  Setting this key to `true` will make CloudCannon use relative paths for
  uploaded files, which are relative to the file being edited rather than the
  repository root.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., CloudCannon uses absolute paths for
  uploaded files).


  Available for the Content Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block editable
  region (`_editables.block`), the Image editable region (`_editables.image`),
  the Text editable region (`_editables.text`), and Rich Text inputs
  (`_inputs.key_name.options`).
