title: Resize Style
description: |-
  This key defines how image files are resized prior to upload, using a bounding box defined by `width` and `height` options.
  
  Valid values are `cover`, `contain`, `crop`, or `stretch`:
  
  * `cover` keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image covers the bounding box
  * `contain` keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image fits inside the bounding box
  * `crop` prompts the user with and interface to select an aspect-ratio-respecting area
  * `stretch` ignores aspect ratio and resizes the image to the bounding box
  
  This key does not apply to existing images, and does not work if `width` and `height` options are not defined.
  
  Available for the Content Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block editable region (`_editables.block`), the Image editable region
  (`_editables.image`), and Rich Text inputs (`_inputs.key_name.options`).
examples:
  - description: In this example, we have configured an *Image Input* to resize images using the `cover` style to ensure images cover the bounding box while maintaining aspect ratio.
