title: Resize Style
description: |-
  This key defines how image files are resized prior to upload, using a bounding box defined by `width` and `height` options. Defaults to `contain`. Valid values are `contain`, `cover` or `stretch`:

  * `cover` keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image covers the bounding box
  * `contain` keeps aspect ratio and ensures the image fits inside the bounding box
  * `stretch` ignores aspect ratio and resizes the image to the bounding box

  This key does not apply to existing images, and does not work if `width` and `height` options are not defined.

  Available for the Content Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block editable region (`_editables.block`), the Image editable region (`_editables.image`), and Rich Text inputs (`_inputs.key_name.options`).
