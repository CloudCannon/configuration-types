  This key defines the minimum numerical value CloudCannon will allow in an Input.
  
  When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from entering a lesser numerical value.
  
  If the Input already contains a lesser numerical value, CloudCannon will require you to enter a valid value to save your changes, or discard your
  unsaved changes.
  
  This key is required for `range` inputs.
  
  Value can be any number.
  
  If `options.max` is also configured, this key cannot be a greater number.
  
  This key has no default.
  
  This key is available for Number Inputs.
