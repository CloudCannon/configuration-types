  This key defines the options available in the *\+ Add* button dropdown at the
  top right of your *Collection browser*.


  Configuring add options for a Collection will remove CloudCannon's default
  "Add a file" option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.


  Additionally, any Schemas you have configured for a Collection will also
  appear in the *\+ Add* dropdown.
examples:

      In this example, we have configured two standard add options for the
      `people` Collection. The first option uses the `employee` Schema, and the
      second option uses the `contractor` Schema and opens files in the [Data
      Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/).
