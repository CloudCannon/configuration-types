  This key defines the options available in the *\+ Add* button dropdown at the top right of your *Collection browser*.

  Configuring add options for a Collection will remove CloudCannon's default "Add a file" option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.

  Additionally, any Schemas you have configured for a Collection will also appear in the *\+ Add* dropdown.

  For more information on these options, please read our reference documentation on [disable\_add](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#disable_add), [disable\_add\_folder](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#disable_add_folder), and [schemas](/documentation/articles/schemas-reference/#schemas).
examples:
  - description: In this example, we have configured two standard add options for the `people` Collection. The first option uses the `employee` Schema, and the second option uses the `contractor` Schema and opens files in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/).
