  This key defines globs that filter the files visible in the *Collection
  browser* for a given Collection. Values in this array are relative to the
  Collection [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path).


  Globs can be positive (e.g., `*.yml`) or negative (e.g., `!**/*.json`). Files
  are included in a Collection if they match any positive globs and do not match
  any negative globs. If you do not define any positive globs, CloudCannon will
  include all non-developer files in a Collection unless they match a negative
  glob.


  Defining a negative glob for a Collection does not remove a file from the
  associated Collection folder in your Git repository. Similarly, defining a
  positive glob for a file in a folder outside your Collection path does not
  move the file.


  This key has no default.

      In this example, the *Collection browser* will show all files in the
      `data` folder except for the `secret.yml` file:
    code: |-
      collections_config:
        data:
          path: data
          glob:
            - '!secret.yml'
  - description: >-
      In this example, the *Collection browser* will show only `.yml` files in the `data` folder or any nested folders:
    code: |-
      collections_config:
        data:
          path: data
          glob:
            - '**/*.yml'
