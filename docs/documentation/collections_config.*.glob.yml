  This key defines globs which filter the files visible in the *Collection
  browser* for a given Collection.


  Values in this array are relative to the Collection
  [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path).


  Globs can be positive (e.g. `*.yml`), or negative (e.g. `!**/*.json`).


  Files are included in a Collection if they match any positive globs and do not
  match any negative globs.


  If you do not define any positive globs, CloudCannon will include all
  non-developer files in a Collection unless they match a negative

  glob.


  > For more information about developer files, please read our documentation on
  the
  [include\_developer\_files](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#include_developer_files)
  key.


  Defining a negative glob for a Collection does not remove a file from the
  associated Collection folder in your Git repository.


  Similarly, defining a positive glob for a file in a folder outside your
  Collection path does not move the file.

      In this example, the *Collection browser* will show all files in the
      `data` folder except for the `secret.yml` file.

      collections_config:
        data:

            - '!secret.yml'
    annotations: []

      In this example, the *Collection browser* will show only `.yml` files in
      the `data` folder or any nested folders.
