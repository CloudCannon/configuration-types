  This key defines the date and time, exclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in
  an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting a later
  date and time. If the Input already contains a later date and time,
  CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to save your
  changes, or discard your unsaved changes. Value must be in ISO8601 format. If
  options.start_from is also configured, this key cannot be an earlier date and
  time. This key has no default.
