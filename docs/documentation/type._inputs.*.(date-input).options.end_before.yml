  This key defines the date and time, exclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in
  an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting a later
  date and time. If the Input already contains a  later date and time,
  CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to save your
  changes, or discard your unsaved changes.


  Value must be in
  [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format. If
  `options.start_from` is also configured, this key cannot be an earlier date
  and time.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Date and Time Inputs.
