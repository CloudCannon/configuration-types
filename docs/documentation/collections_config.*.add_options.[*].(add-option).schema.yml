  This key defines which *Schema* CloudCannon should use to populate a file
  created with a standard add option in the *\+ Add* button dropdown.


  The value is a string that specifies the key name of a *Schema* defined in
  `schemas` to use as the default content for the new file.


  Configuring this key will override `add_options.default_content_file`.


  By default, this key uses the default *Schema* in the Collection configured in
  `add_options.collection` (or the containing collection if `collection` is not
  specified), if *Schemas* are configured for that collection. Otherwise, this
  key has no default value.
examples:

      In this example, we have configured a standard add option for the `people`
      Collection that uses the `employee` *Schema* to populate new files.
