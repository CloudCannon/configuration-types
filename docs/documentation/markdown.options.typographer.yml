  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will enable typographic replacements and
  quote beautification when converting Markdown to HTML.


  Setting this key to `true` will enable language-neutral replacements (such as
  dashes and ellipses) and beautify quotes based on the `quotes` configuration.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., typographic replacements and quote
  beautification are disabled).
