  This key defines the minimum number of items CloudCannon will allow in an
  Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from removing items from
  this Input below this value. If the Input already contains fewer items,
  CloudCannon will require you to add items until the Input contains a valid
  number to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.
