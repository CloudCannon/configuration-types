  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will enable GitHub Flavored Markdown
  (GFM) mode when processing Markdown.


  Setting this key to `true` will enable GFM mode, which includes features like
  tables, strikethrough, task lists, and autolinks.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., GFM mode is disabled).
