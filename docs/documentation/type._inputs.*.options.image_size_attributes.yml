  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will instruct a rich text editor to save
  `width` and `height` attributes on image elements.


  Setting this key to `true` will instruct the rich text editor to save `width`
  and `height` attributes on image elements. This can prevent pop-in as a page
  loads.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., width and height attributes are not
  saved on image elements). This defaults to `true` if the [Image Size
  Attributes site
  flag](/documentation/articles/legacy-option-flags/#image-size-attributes-default-behaviour)
  is enabled (this is enabled for sites created before June 23 2023, in order to
  keep those sites working).
