title: Image Size Attributes
description: |-
  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will instruct a rich text editor to save `width` and `height` on image elements.
  
  Setting this key to `true` will instruct the rich text editor to save `width` and `height` on image elements. This can prevent pop-in as a page loads.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., width and height attributes are not saved on image elements). This defaults to `true` for sites created before June 23 2023, in order to keep those sites working.
  
  Available for the Content Editor (`_editables.content`), the Block editable region (`_editables.block`), the Image editable region
  (`_editables.image`), and Rich Text inputs (`_inputs.key_name.options`).
