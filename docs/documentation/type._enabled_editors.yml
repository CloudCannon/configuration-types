description: |-
  This key defines which editing interfaces are available by default for files at a given level of the configuration cascade.
  
  Whether an editing interface is available for a specific file is determined by other factors.
  
  Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`.
  
  Specifying one or more editing interfaces will disable all unspecified editing interfaces.
  
  You cannot disable the Source Editor with this key.
  
  By default, this key is set to `visual`, `content`, and `data`.
  
  If undefined at higher levels of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_enabled_editables` will
  default to any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).
  
  For more information, please read our documentation on the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), [Content
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/).
