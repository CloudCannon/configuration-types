  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide the option to link to an email
  address.


  Setting this key to `true` will hide the option to link to an email address.
  This does not prevent typing a `mailto:` link in the input.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., the option to link to an email address
  is shown).
