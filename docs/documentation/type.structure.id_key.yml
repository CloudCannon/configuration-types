  This key defines which key within `values[*].value` CloudCannon should use to
  identify the Structure option.


  If CloudCannon cannot find this key in a Structure value, it will compare all
  other key names in the Structure value to find the correct one.


  By default, this key is `_type`.

      In this example, we have change the `id_key` from the default `_type` to
      `component` to match our existing configuration in the `content_blocks`
      Array input.

          We have configured the Array input `content_blocks` to use the
          `page_components` Structures.
      - number: 2
        content: The `id_key` for `page_components` is `component`.
      - number: 3
        content: >-
          Each option in the `values` array has the `component` key with a
          different value to identify that option.
