description: >-
  This key defines the earliest date and time, inclusive, that CloudCannon will
  allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from
  selecting an earlier date and time. If the Input already contains an earlier
  date and time, CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to
  save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes. Value must be in ISO8601
  format. If `options.end_before` is also configured, this key cannot be a later
  date and time.
