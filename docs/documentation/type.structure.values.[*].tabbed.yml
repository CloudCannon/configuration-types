  This key toggles whether CloudCannon should create tabs in the Data Editor if you have two layers of nested object within your Structure.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    CloudCannon would create tabs automatically for Non-unified Configuration Sites, but it must be explicitly configured in the Unified Configuration file format.
  </comp.Notice>

  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., Object and Array inputs using this Structure option are not tabbed).
examples:
  - description: In this example, we want the `content` and `style` keys in our Structure to be tabs at the top of the Data Editor, with the `title` and `text`, and `color` and `font` keys nested within those tabs respectively.
