  This key toggles whether CloudCannon should create tabs in the Data Editor if
  you have two layers of nested object within your Structure.


  Setting this key to `true` will create tabs in the Data Editor for two layers
  of nested objects within your Structure.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., Object and Array inputs using this
  Structure option are not tabbed).
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we want the `content` and `style` keys in our Structure
      to be tabs at the top of the Data Editor, with the `title` and `text`, and
      `color` and `font` keys nested within those tabs respectively.
