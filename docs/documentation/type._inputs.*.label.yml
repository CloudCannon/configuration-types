  This key changes the bold title text above an Input.


  By default, CloudCannon generates the value from the Input key name, in title
  case (e.g., `page_title` will become "Page Title").
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we want to customize the label for our `page_title` Input
      to be more descriptive.
