  This key defines the appearance of a Card when choosing an item to create.
  This uses `preview` as a base, and keys inside this object are overrides.


  You can configure Card preview for
  [Collections](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/),
  [Schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/),

  [Object inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-object-input/), [Array
  inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-array-input/), [Select

  inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/),
  [Structures](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-structure/), the Structure
  modal,

  [Snippets](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-snippet/), and the Snippet modal.


  For more information about previews, please read our documentation on
  [configuring card
