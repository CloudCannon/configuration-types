  This key defines which key an option in the *Sort* dropdown should use to sort files in your *Collection browser*.
  
  You must define this key for every entry in the `sort_options` array for the object to function.
  
  Value must be the name of a structured data key in your Collection files.
  
  If some files in your Collection do not have this data key, CloudCannon will sort those in ascending alphabetical order, after the file sorted by your
  data key in the *Collection browser*.
  
  This key has no default.
