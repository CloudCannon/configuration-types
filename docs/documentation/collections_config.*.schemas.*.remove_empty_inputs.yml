  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove empty nested inputs from a file using a given Schema before persisting them to your file.
  
  Setting this key to `true` will remove empty nested inputs from a file using a given Schema before persisting them to your file. CloudCannon considers an input to be empty when its value is `null`, `' '`, or undefined. If this key is true, empty inputs will be visible in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/) and the sidebar of the
  [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) and [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), but not
  the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). For this key to function, you must also define _schema in your file.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., CloudCannon does not remove empty inputs).
