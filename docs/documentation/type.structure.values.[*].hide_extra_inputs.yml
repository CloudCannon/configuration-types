  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide inputs that are not present in a given value from a Structure from the [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/).
  
  Setting this key to `true` will hide inputs that are not present in a given value from a Structure from the Data Editor. Hiding these inputs does not delete the data. You can see non-structure data keys by opening a file in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is `true`.
  
  You can also configure this behavior for all values of a Structure using `hide_extra_inputs` inside `_structures.*`.
