  This key defines how CloudCannon shows Structure options to populate an Object or Array input.
  
  This can be using a Select-style search bar or a pop-up modal.
  
  Modals are useful when you have several value options for your Structure.
  
  Values can be one of the following: `select`, or `modal`.
  
  By default, this key is `select`.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, the `related_articles` Structure only has one option so a
      `select` searchbar is appropriate.
