  This key defines the maximum number of items CloudCannon will allow in an
  Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from adding more items to
  this Input. If the Input already contains more items, CloudCannon will require
  you to remove items until the Input contains a valid number to save your
  changes, or discard your unsaved changes.
