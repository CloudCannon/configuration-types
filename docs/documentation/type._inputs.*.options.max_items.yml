  This key defines the maximum number of items CloudCannon will allow in an
  Input.


  When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from adding more items to this
  Input.


  If the Input already contains more items, CloudCannon will require you to
  remove items until the Input contains a valid number to save your changes,

  or discard your unsaved changes.


  Value can be any positive integer.


  If `options.min_items` is also configured, this key cannot be a lesser number.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Array and Multiselect or Multichoice Inputs.
