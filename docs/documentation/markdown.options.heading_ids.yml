  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will generate IDs for headings when
  converting Markdown to HTML.


  Setting this key to `true` will automatically generate ID attributes for
  heading elements based on their text content.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., IDs are not generated for headings).
