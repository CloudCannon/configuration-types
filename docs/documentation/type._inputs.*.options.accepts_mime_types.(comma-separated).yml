title: Comma Separated Accepts Mime Types
description: >-
  This key represents a comma-separated string format for the
  `accepts_mime_types` key that restricts which file types are available to
  select or upload in *File Inputs*.


  The value is a string containing MIME types separated by commas. Each MIME
  type specifies a file type that CloudCannon will allow for this input.


  Available MIME types include image formats (`image/x-icon`, `image/gif`,
  `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/bmp`, `image/svg+xml`) and
  document formats (`application/pdf`, `application/msword`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`,
  `application/vnd.ms-excel`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`,
  `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`).


  Use the comma-separated format when you prefer a more compact configuration or
  when working with a small number of MIME types.


  The special value `"*"` means any file type is accepted.
