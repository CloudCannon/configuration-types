  This key defines the path to the file CloudCannon should use as the value of
  the `body` field in a Pull Request template. This file path must be relative
  to the root of your repository (i.e., `/`, not the value of `source`). This
  allows you to create more complex default content for your Pull Request.


  CloudCannon will not use the content of this file if the `body` key is also
  defined for the Pull Request template.


  This key has no default.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, the `body` field of our Pull Request template is
      populated by the contents of `.github/templates/delete-content.md` by
      default.
