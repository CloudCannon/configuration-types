  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will render snippets as plain text within
  code blocks when processing Markdown.


  Setting this key to `true` will prevent snippets from being processed within
  code blocks, rendering them as plain text instead.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., snippets within code blocks may be
  processed).
