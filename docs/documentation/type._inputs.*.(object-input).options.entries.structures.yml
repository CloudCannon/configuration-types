  This key defines which predefined templates to use for populating entries nested in the *Object Input*.

  The value can be a string or an object. When configured, team members can select a [structure](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-structure/) to populate the Object with input/input groups.

  If configured as an object, CloudCannon will use the values directly. If configured as a string, CloudCannon will use the matching structures value defined under `_structures` in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/developer-articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

  Available for Mutable Objects only.

  > **Note:** This key looks similar to `structures`. However, the `structures` key applies to the Object input itself, while `entries.structures` applies to the entries within the object.

  This key has no default.
