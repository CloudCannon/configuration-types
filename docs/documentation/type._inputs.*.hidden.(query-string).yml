title: Query String
description: >-
  This key represents a query string value for the `hidden` key that
  conditionally hides an input based on another input's value.


  The value is a string that references a sibling input key name. CloudCannon
  evaluates the referenced input's value to determine whether to hide this
  input.


  When the referenced input is truthy, CloudCannon hides this input. You can
  reverse this behavior by prefixing the string with `!`.


  For reverse values in YAML files, the string should be wrapped in single or
  double quotation marks.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we have configured an input to be hidden when the
      `published` input is truthy.
    language: yaml
    code: |-
      _inputs:
        published:
          type: checkbox
          label: Published
        draft_notes:
          type: textarea
          label: Draft notes
          hidden: published

  - description: >-
      In this example, we have configured an input to be hidden when the
      `published` input is falsy using the `!` prefix.
    language: yaml
    code: |-
      _inputs:
        published:
          type: checkbox
