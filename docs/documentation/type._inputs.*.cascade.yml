  This key defines whether CloudCannon should merge this input configuration
  with any matching, less specific configurations elsewhere in the

  configuration cascade.


  The [configuration
  cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) works by
  finding the most specific `_inputs` entry.


  Usually, once an option is found in the cascade, there's no reason to keep
  looking.


  When this key is `true`, the cascade continues looking and each entry found is
  merged.


  This key allows you to define some options globally while using specific
  options for other keys at different levels of the cascade.


  For example, define a `comment` globally, but use collection-specific `label`
  for inputs in different collections.


  You can stop the cascade at any point in the configuration cascade by setting
  `cascade` to `false`.

      In this example, we have configured cascade to merge input configurations
      across the configuration cascade.
