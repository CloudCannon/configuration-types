  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will save element attributes in Markdown
  format instead of converting them to HTML when converting HTML to Markdown.


  Setting this key to `true` will preserve element attributes in Markdown format
  (using attribute lists) rather than converting them to HTML.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., element attributes are converted to
  HTML).
