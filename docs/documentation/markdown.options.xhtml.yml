  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will use XHTML-style closing for single
  tags when converting Markdown to HTML.


  Setting this key to `true` will use `/` to close single tags (e.g., `<br />`
  instead of `<br>`).


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., single tags are not closed with `/`).
