  This key defines a limited set of key names for nested keys within your
  *Object Input*.


  The value is an array of key name strings. This affects entries when adding or
  renaming nested keys.


  This set is used when entries are added and renamed with `allow_create`
  enabled. Has no effect if `allow_create` is not enabled.


  Available for Mutable Objects only.


  By default, this key is `[]`.
