  This key defines the name for the structured data key that references the
  Schema a file uses.


  CloudCannon automatically adds this key to the top of your file when you
  create it using a Schema.


  Values which beginning with the `_` character are hidden from the Data Editor
  and the sidebar of the Content and Visual Editors.

      In this example, we want to make Schemas more friendly for our
      non-technical team members, so we have configured the schema key in the
      front matter of files in the `blog` Collection to be `blog_template`.
