  This key toggles whether inputs that are not present in the Structure are
  visible in the [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/). Hiding these inputs
  does not delete the data. You can see structured data keys from outside a
  Structure by opening a file in the [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no
  effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is `true`.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e, non-structure inputs are visible in the
  Data Editor).
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we don't want inputs outside of those listed in the
      Structure (e.g., old inputs from deprecated versions of this Structure) to
      appear in the Data Editor.
