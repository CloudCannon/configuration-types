  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide inputs that are not present in a Structure from the [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/). Hiding these inputs does not delete the data. You can
  see non-structure data keys by opening a file in the [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is
  `true`. 
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e, non-structure inputs are visible in the Data Editor). You can also
  configure this behavior for specific values of a Structure using `structure.values.[*].hide_extra_inputs`.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we don't want inputs outside of those listed in the
      Structure (e.g., old inputs from deprecated versions of this Structure) to
      appear in the Data Editor.
