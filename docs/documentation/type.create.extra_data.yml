  This key defines additional data placeholders for use in create path templates.

  The value is an object where each property is a string that specifies a data placeholder. Entry values follow the same format as `path`, and are processed sequentially before `path`. These values are not saved back to your file.

  For more information, please read our documentation on [Create Paths](/documentation/articles/set-the-path-for-new-files/).
