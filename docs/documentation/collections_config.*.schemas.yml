  This key defines which Schemas are available to populate files in this Collection.

  Defining a Schema for a collection will add it to the *\+ Add* button dropdown at the top right of the *Collection browser*.

  If undefined, clicking the *\+ Add* button to add a new file to a Collection will clone the last file in the Collection and clear any markup content
  and the values of any structured data keys.
examples:
  - description: In this example, the *\+ Add* button in the *Collection browser* has an option for `Customer Story` which will populate a new file in the `blog` Collection with the contents of the `customer_story.mdx` file. If the Schema file is updated, CloudCannon will preserve the old inputs to prevent you from losing structured data in older files.
