description: |-
  This key defines the key used for mapping between saved values and objects in values.
  
  This changes how the input saves selected values to match.
  
  Defaults to checking for "id", "uuid", "path", "title", then "name".
  
  Has no effect unless values is an array of objects, the key is used instead for objects, and the value itself is used for primitive types.
