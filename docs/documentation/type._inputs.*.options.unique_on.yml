  This key defines the JSON Path selector that CloudCannon should use to
  determine if the value of an Input is unique.


  When configured, CloudCannon will require the value of the Input to be unique
  compared to the value defined on the JSON Path.


  If the Input already contains a non-unique value, CloudCannon will require you
  to change it to a valid value to save your changes, or discard your

  unsaved changes.


  Value must be a valid JSON Path.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Array inputs.
