  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will treat repeating snippets as optional
  when parsing snippet parameters.


  Setting this key to `true` will make the repeating snippet instances optional,
  allowing snippets to match even when no instances are present.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., at least one instance is required).

      optional.
