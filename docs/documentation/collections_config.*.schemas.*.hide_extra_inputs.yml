  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide inputs that are not present in
  a Schema from the [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/) and the sidebar of
  the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) and
  [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/).


  Setting this key to `true` will hide inputs that are not present in a Schema
  from the Data Editor and the sidebar of the Visual Editor and Content Editor.
  Hiding these inputs does not delete the data. You can see non-schema data keys
  by opening a file in the [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no
  effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is `true`.

      In this example, CloudCannon will hide non-schema inputs in files using
      the `article` schema in the `blog` Collection.
