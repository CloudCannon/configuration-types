  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will hide inputs that are not present in a Schema from the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/) and the sidebar of the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) and [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/).
  
  Setting this key to `true` will hide inputs that are not present in a Schema from the Data Editor and the sidebar of the Visual Editor and Content Editor. Hiding these inputs does not delete the data. You can see non-schema data keys by opening a file in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is `true`.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., non-schema inputs are visible in the Data Editor).
