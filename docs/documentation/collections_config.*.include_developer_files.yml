  This key toggles whether CloudCannon removes developer files from your
  *Collection browser*. CloudCannon excludes files that probably shouldn't be
  edited in a CMS from your *Collection browser*, for example files like
  `README.md` or

  `package.json`. CloudCannon excludes these files even if you have configured
  globs to allow them.


  Setting this key to `true` will allow CloudCannon to show developer files,

  assuming they are not filtered out by any configured

  [globs](/documentation/developer-reference/configuration-file/collections_config/*/glob/). 
examples:

      In this example, we want to see developer files in the *Collection
      browser* for the `data` Collection.
