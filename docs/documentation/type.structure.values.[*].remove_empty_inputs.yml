description: |-
  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove empty nested inputs from an Object Input or Array Input using a given value from a Structure before
  persisting them to your file.
  
  CloudCannon considers an input to be empty when its value is `null`, `' '`, or undefined.
  
  If this key is true, empty inputs will be visible in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/) but not the [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/).
  
  For this key to function, you must also configure `id_key` for the Structure, as removing inputs prevents CloudCannon from comparing Structure values.
  
  By default, this key is `false` (i.e, CloudCannon does not remove empty inputs).
  
  You can also configure this behavior for all values of a Structure using structure.remove_empty_inputs.
