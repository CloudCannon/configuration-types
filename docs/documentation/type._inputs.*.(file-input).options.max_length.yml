  This key defines the maximum string length, in characters, that CloudCannon
  will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will warn you when an
  Input value is too long. If the Input already contains a longer value,
  CloudCannon will require you to remove characters until the Input contains a
  valid string to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.
