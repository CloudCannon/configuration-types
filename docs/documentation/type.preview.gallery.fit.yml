  This key defines how images fit within their containers in the gallery section
  of a *Card*.


  Valid values are `padded` (default), `contain`, `cover`, or `cover-top`.


  * The `padded` value adds padding around images to maintain aspect ratio.

  * The `contain` value ensures images fit entirely within the container by
  setting the largest dimension of the image to the largest dimension of the
  container, while maintaining aspect ratio.

  * The `cover` value ensures images cover the entire container while
  maintaining aspect ratio, aligning the center of the image with the center of
  the container.

  * The `cover-top` value ensures images cover the entire container while
  maintaining aspect ratio, aligning the top of the image with the top of the
  container.


  This key defaults to `contain`.

      In this example, we have configured the gallery fit to use `cover` so
      images cover the entire container while maintaining aspect ratio, aligning
      the center of the image with the center of the container.
