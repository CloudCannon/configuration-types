title: ''
description: >-
  This key defines the minimum number of items CloudCannon will allow in an
  Input.


  When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from removing items from this
  Input below this value.


  If the Input already contains fewer items, CloudCannon will require you to add
  items until the Input contains a valid number to save your changes, or

  discard your unsaved changes.


  Value can be any positive integer.


  If `options.min_items` is also configured, this key cannot be a greater
  number.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Array and Multiselect or Multichoice Inputs.
