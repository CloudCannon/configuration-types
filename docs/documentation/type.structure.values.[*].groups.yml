description: |-
  This key defines the order and customing grouping for inputs within a Structure.

  Each groups can have a heading.

  By default, CloudCannon respects the order of inputs as configured in the `values.value` key and does not include any groups.
examples:
  - description: 'In this example, we want to separate the inputs into two groups with descriptive headings: `title` and `subtitle` under the `Titles` heading, and `author` under the `Details` heading.'
