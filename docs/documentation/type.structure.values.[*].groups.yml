gid: type.structure.values.[*].groups

description: >-
  This key defines the order and customing grouping for inputs within a
  Structure. Each groups can have a heading.


  The following nested keys are available for each entry in the `groups` array:


  * `heading`

  * `inputs`


  By default, CloudCannon respects the order of inputs as configured in the
  `values.value` key and does not include any groups.
examples:
  - description: >-
      In this example, we want to separate the inputs into two groups with
      descriptive headings: `title` and `subtitle` under the `Titles` heading,
      and `author` under the `Details` heading.
