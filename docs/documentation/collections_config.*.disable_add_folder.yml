  This key toggles whether team members can use the *\+ Add* button in the top
  right of the *Collection browser* to add subfolders to a Collection.


  Setting this key to `true` will prevent team members from adding new
  subfolders through the *Collection browser*. This key does not affect your
  ability to add subfolders using the *File browser*.



  If both `disable_add` and `disable_add_folder` are set to `true`, the *\+ Add*
  button will not

  appear in the top right of the *Collection browser*.

      In this example, we want to prevent team members from adding new
      subfolders to the `data` Collection through the *Collection browser*.
