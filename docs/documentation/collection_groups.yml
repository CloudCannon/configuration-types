  This key defines custom order and grouping for Collections in your *Site
  Navigation*.


  The value is an array of group objects. Each group object must contain a
  `heading` key and a `collections` key.


  If undefined, CloudCannon will sort your Collections in the order they are
  defined under the `collections_config` key.
