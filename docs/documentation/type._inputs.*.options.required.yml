  This key toggles whether CloudCannon requires this Input to have a value. If
  set to `true`, CloudCannon will require you to enter a value to save your
  changes, or discard your unsaved changes.


  By default, this key is `false` (i.e, CloudCannon does not require this Input
  to have a value).


  This key is available for Array, Code, Color, Date and Time, File, Number,
  Object, Select and Multiselect, Text, Rich Text, and URL Inputs.
