  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove inputs that are not present in a Structure from a file before
  loading it in an Editing Interface. If set to `true`, non-Structure inputs will not be  visible in the [Visual
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/),  [Content
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), or  [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and saving the file will remove  them from the file
  before persisting the changes to your Git repository. By default, this key is `false`  (i.e., inputs not present
  in the Structure are not removed from the file). You can also configure  this behavior for specific values of a
  Structure using `structure.values.[*].remove_extra_inputs`.

      In this example, we want to delete old inputs that are not in the
      Structure from the associated file.
