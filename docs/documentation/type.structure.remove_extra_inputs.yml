  This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove inputs that are not present
  in a Structure from a file before loading it in an Editing Interface.


  Setting this key to `true` will remove inputs that are not present in a
  Structure from a file before loading it in an Editing Interface. Non-Structure
  inputs will not be visible in the [Visual
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), [Content

  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/), or [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/), and saving the file

  will remove them from the file before persisting the changes to your Git
  repository.


  You can also configure this behavior for specific values of a Structure using
  `values[*].remove_extra_inputs`.
examples:

      In this example, we want to delete old inputs that are not in the
      Structure from the associated file.
