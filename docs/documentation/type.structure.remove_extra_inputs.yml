  This key toggles whether inputs that are not present in the Structure are
  removed from the file before CloudCannon loads it in an editing interface.
  Saving the file will push this change to your Git repository.


  By default, this key is `false`(i.e., inputs not present in the Structure are
  not removed from the file).
